## What is Prism?

Prism is a modern, responsive Home Assistant dashboard with a glassmorphism design.  
It combines semi-transparent "frosted glass" surfaces with neumorphism elements for haptic feedback and uses smart YAML anchors to keep the code lean, consistent, and easy to maintain.

Prism is optimized for wall tablets and smartphones and is ideal as a central smart home hub for everyday use.

> **📝 Note:** The dashboard configuration (YAML) was completely hand-written by me.  
> The custom JavaScript cards were developed with AI assistance (Cursor AI).

## Features

- **💎 Glassmorphism UI**  
  Semi-transparent "Frosted Glass" cards with blur effects for a modern, premium look.

- **👆 Haptic Feedback (Neumorphism)**  
  Active buttons appear "pressed" and provide visual feedback on interactions.

- **🧭 Smart Navigation**  
  Animated navigation bar that automatically highlights the current room or active view.

- **🌈 Status Glow**  
  Icons glow in appropriate colors depending on state (e.g., green for security, orange for heating).

- **📱 Responsive Grid**  
  Layout seamlessly adapts to different devices (tablet on the wall, smartphone in hand).

- **🧹 Clean Code with YAML Anchors**  
  Uses YAML anchors (`&` and `*`) to avoid repetition and keep global style changes centralized.

## Requirements

For this dashboard to work, the following frontend integrations must be installed via **HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)**:

- **Mushroom Cards**  
  Base for almost all cards in the dashboard.

- **card-mod**  
  Essential for CSS and glassmorphism styling.

- **layout-card**  
  Enables the responsive grid layout (sidebar + main area).

- **kiosk-mode**  
  Hides Home Assistant header and sidebar for a clean fullscreen look.

- **mini-graph-card**  
  For temperature and trend graphs.

- **browser_mod**  
  Important for popups (e.g., calendar, vacuum control).
